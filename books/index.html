Two Scotsmen steal her away to a dark castle where she joins a clan of redcapes—creatures who soak their capes in blood to survive. The castle is infiltrated by redcape hunters and Margaret discovers she is a sorceress, or a heart-taker, and sorcery may be the way to free herself from her cape and reclaim the life she was meant to have.</p><p>Gudrun, a sorceress in Burgundy and Margaret's ancestor, would like nothing more than to ease her guilty conscience. She kills and regrets, and her mother makes her forget—it's a cycle Gudrun can't escape, until she meets a man who brings light to her dark world. With him, she's happy, but her happiness is short-lived. She wakes to find him murdered and devotes her life to resurrecting her one true love.</p><em>Pitched as Outlander meets Grave Mercy but with more gore and less romance, Hearts Like Silver is a dark, historical fantasy that explores themes of forgiveness, hope and freedom.</em><p class="tiny-text"><em>Hearts Like Silver</em> is slated for publication in 2024. The cover shown is a stand-in cover.</p></div></div></section></main><footer><p>Copyright © 2023 Jamie Sheehan | All Rights Reserved</p></footer></body></html>
